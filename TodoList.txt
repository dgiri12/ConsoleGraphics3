-
-Add recalibration of the startTime variable to the change sprite functionality because sprite needs to start at image zero.
-Finish the particleSystem class
-Add a feature where the instance will be able to see if the animation is over, and then destroy itself
-Add local events for instances
-Collision needs to be detected with instances based on their actionIndex, there can be multiple spaceships, but they have the same
action index because they need to be programmed only once on their actions.

-Currently stuck in trying to set the ENDOFANIMATION event in game.render() function inside consolegraphics3.cpp
if (spriteArray[instanceArray[i].getSpriteIndex()].getImageIndex()==0) instanceArray[i].setInsEvent();
